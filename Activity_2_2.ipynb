        " Constants are variables whose values should not change during the program's execution. Although Python does not have built-in support for constants, you can use a naming convention to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant.\n",

        " In conclusion, the goal of incorporating literals and variables into a Python program was successfully achieved. The program was able to accurately calculate the final grades for a CpE course by using basic math operations and conditional statements to ensure that the inputs were within the correct range. To test the program, data for three students was input, and it correctly displayed each student’s Prelim, Midterm, and Final grades, which were then converted to the UCC grading system. This exercise provided a hands-on opportunity to learn how to use literals and variables effectively, while also applying basic mathematical operations and conditional logic in Python. It reinforced the understanding of how to write a program that processes and validates input to produce the desired output\n"
